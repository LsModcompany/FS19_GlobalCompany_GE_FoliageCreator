# Map tools

## Foliage Creator
---------------

> The foliage Creator script makes it easy to paint different foliage types.
Creating Deko foliage can be very hard. This tool helps and generates the
necessary foliage types. In combination with the Map tool.
>
>
**Field Dimensions with Bitmap** has even more features available. With (\*) everything related to this map tool is marked after the following.**

## General Info
------------

**There are three different. Types available:

-   Grass, forest and grass decoration.  
    In grass and grass decoration, grass is always planted as a substrate. With
    the two types you can then define different deko foliage’s.**

## Map preparation
---------------

1.  First, copy the fruitDensity.grle file to the maps/map folder (or other
    folders) of the map. The file can be found on Github at the script.

2.  Open the map in Notepad++ or another text editor and look for *\<Files \>*
    include: *→*  
    *\<File fileId="206000000" filename="map/fruitDensity.png"/\>*

3.  An info layer must be added as the next. Searches here for InfoLayer. These
    are located in the Terrain Transform Group. Add the following entry to the
    InfoLayers lines¨ found: *→*  
    *\<InfoLayer name="fruitDensity" fileId="206000000" numChannels="8"/\>*

4.  The map can now be saved and opened in the Giants Editor.

## Script setting
--------------

1.  Creates a new script with scripts. Enter a name and click Create.

2.  Now delete the comments in the script and copy the script from Github.  
    <https://github.com/Ls-Modcompany/FS19_GlobalCompany_GE_FoliageCreator>

3.  Now some settings and changes in various lines of the script have to be
    made:

    -   **Line 9:** *pathFruitDensityGrle →* Here the path to the file
        *fruitDensity.grle* must be given.

    -   **Line 10:** *pathFieldDimensions →* Here the path to the file
        *fieldDimensions.grle must be* specified. (\*)

    -   **Line 13:** *bitsFruitDensityGdm →* Number of bits of FruitGdm. A
        Change to “no” if the standard value is not maintained.

    -   **Line 14:** *bitsFruitDensityGrle →* Number of bits of the grle. No
        change.

    -   **Line 15:** *bitsFieldDimensionsGrle →* Number of bits of the field
        dimensions grle. Do not change if the standard value is not maintained.

    -   In **line 17-36** there are the available Id’s. *→* Id’s must be
        assigned.

    -   **Line 40**: *bit grass state →* State for grass (19 wa ' re State4 and
        thus the waxed grass)

    -   **Line 40:** *bit grass states →* Array with Id's. It can be set which
        de- co foliage should be planted on "grass".

    -   **Line 43:** *bit forest states →* Array with Id's. It can be set which
        deco foliage should be planted on "forest floor".

    -   **Line 46:** *bit grassDeco states →* Array with Id's. It is possible to
        set which deco foliage should be planted on "grass".

    -   **Line 43:** *bit grass factor →* density of foliage. The higher the
        more desto mehr Foliage is created.

    -   **Line 46:** *bit forest factor →* Density of Foliage. The higher the
        more Foliage is created

    -   **Line 49:** *bit grass Deco factor →* Density of Foliage. The higher
        the higher the more foliage is created

    -   **Line 51:** *maxFactor →* Here the next factor of the above must be.

4.  **Save the script**.

## Layer painting
--------------

Now the infolayer can be selected in the Info Layer Painting window. The values
have the following meaning:

-   (Bit 0) → Grass

-   (Bit 1) → Forest

-   (Bit 0 & 1) → Grass Decoration

## Script 
-------

After the layers have been drawn, the current scene must first be saved in the
Giants Editor. Only then can the script be executed.

(When saving the layers in the file, which is then loaded when the script is
run). If the script is executed twice in a row, you will also receive double the
result!

## Fields extension
----------------

If you add the script FieldDimensions with Bitmap, you still have to specify the
path to this GRLE file in line 10. This prevents Foliages from being drawn on a
field.

>   Tip: The layers can then be drawn into the fields, which gives you a better
>   result and is also much faster, because you don't have to draw it exactly!
